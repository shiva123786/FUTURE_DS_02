## üîÑ Project Workflow

1.  **Data Preparation**: The raw CSV data from a simulated ad campaign was loaded into Power Query. Data cleaning steps included handling missing values and ensuring correct data types for metrics like Clicks, Impressions, and Spend.

2.  **Metric Calculation**: New columns and measures were created to calculate essential marketing KPIs that were not present in the original dataset. Key calculated metrics include:
    * **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: `(Total Clicks / Total Impressions)`
    * **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: `(Total Spend / Total Clicks)`
    * **Return on Investment (ROI)**: `( (Revenue - Spend) / Spend )`

3.  **Dashboard Design**: An interactive dashboard was designed to answer key business questions at a glance. The layout was structured to provide a clear narrative, from a high-level overview down to granular details.

4.  **Visualization**: A variety of visuals were used to represent the data effectively:
    * **KPI Cards** for at-a-glance metrics like Total Spend, CTR, and ROI.
    * **Bar Charts** to compare performance across different ad posts or campaigns.
    * **Line Charts** to track performance trends over time.
    * **Tables** to show detailed breakdowns of performance by audience demographics (age, gender, region).

5.  **Interactivity**: Slicers and filters were added to allow users to dynamically filter the dashboard by date, campaign, audience demographics, and device, enabling deep-dive analysis.
